  - what are their most common searches?
  - Anything you can use for next campaigns?
  - Will rearrange the products to feature those product help?
  - Are they searching a different names for the product?
- What pages are people searching from rather than home page?
  - Is that caused by some page experience?
- Time to purchase and session to purchase
  - How long take to conversion
